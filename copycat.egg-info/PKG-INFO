        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
        1. Definitions.
        
           "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
           "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
           direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
           otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

           exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
           "Source" shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

           source, and configuration files.
        
           "Object" shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

           "Work" shall mean the work of authorship covered by this License,
           whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License,
           as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached
           to the work. (For the purposes of this definition, "work" does
           not include relationships, communications, or meetings between
           you and representatives of the Licensor.)
        
           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based upon (or derived from) the Work and for which the
           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
           the Work and derivative works thereof.
        
           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
           the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
           to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
           to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
           communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
           systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
           of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
           but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
           "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
           on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
           subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, prepare
           Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
           and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
           Object form.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
           use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
           where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
           by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
           with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
           cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
           or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
           or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
           granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
           as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
           Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
           modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
           meet the following conditions:
        
           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
               stating that You changed the files; and
        
           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
               that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent,
               attribution and other notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
               the Derivative Works; and
        
           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
               of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
               as modifying the License.
        
           You may add Your own copyright notice(s) to Your modifications and
           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
           the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
           the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
           with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
           names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
           Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Support. You may choose to offer, and to
           charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or other liability
           obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
           accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
           Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
           only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
           harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
           such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or support.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
           replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
           the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
           comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
           identification within third-party archives.

# 🐾 CopyCat – Linux Copy-Paste Superpower

<p align="center">

</p>

*Crafted with ❤️ by Pink Pixel*

## 🚀 What Is CopyCat?

CopyCat is your all-in-one clipboard utility for Linux. It crushes copy-paste headaches in stubborn apps and web UIs. With built-in virtual typing, advanced clipboard tricks, and a clean GUI, CopyCat makes paste restrictions a thing of the past.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Tools

* **Virtual Keyboard Typing** – Simulate real keystrokes to bypass paste blocks
* **Clipboard Control** – Read, write, and manipulate clipboard content
* **Multi-Format Ready** – Handle text, JSON, URLs, API keys, and more
* **GUI & Tray App** – Simple interface with system tray access

### 🔧 Power Features

* **Clipboard History** – Persistent storage with search & management
* **Text Templates** – Reusable snippets at your fingertips
* **Smart Detection** – Auto-detect and adapt to different data types
* **Desktop Integration** – Global shortcuts and menu entries

## 🛠️ Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/copycat.git
cd copycat
pip install .
```

### Guided Setup

Prefer interactive? Run:

```bash
./scripts/setup_copycat.sh
```

Choose `pip`, `uv`, or `conda`—the script builds a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and registers CopyCat.

### Manual Dependencies (Ubuntu/Mint)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xclip xdotool python3-tk libnotify-bin
```

## 📖 Usage

### CLI Basics

```bash
# Core
copycat --get              # Show clipboard
copycat --set "text"       # Set clipboard
copycat --type             # Type clipboard (bypasses restrictions)
copycat --type-delayed     # Type after 3s delay

# Advanced
copycat --history          # Clipboard history
copycat --templates        # Templates list
copycat --gui              # Launch GUI
```

### GUI

* Start from desktop menu, tray icon, or `Ctrl+Alt+V`
* Access history, templates, and one-click “Type Clipboard”

### Usage

1. Copy text, API key, or config
2. Focus input field
3. Use one of these:

   * GUI: click **Type Clipboard**
   * CLI: `copycat --type-delayed` then switch to the designated paste location
   * Shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+T`

## 🎨 Templates

Custom templates live in `~/.config/copycat/templates/`:

```bash
# API key
copycat --template api-key "sk-your-key-here"

# JSON schema
copycat --template json-schema '{"type": "object", "properties": {...}}'
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

* `Ctrl+Alt+V` → Open GUI
* `Ctrl+Alt+T` → Type clipboard
* `Ctrl+Alt+H` → Show history
* `Ctrl+Shift+V` → Enhanced paste (when supported)

## 🔧 Config

Edit `~/.config/copycat/config.conf`:

```ini
[general]
typing_delay = 50
max_history = 100
auto_detect_types = true

[gui]
show_tray_icon = true
start_minimized = false

[shortcuts]
type_clipboard = Ctrl+Alt+T
show_history = Ctrl+Alt+H
open_gui = Ctrl+Alt+V
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Paste still blocked?**

* Try `copycat --type-delayed`
* Confirm `xdotool` is installed
* Ensure input field focus

**GUI not showing?**

* Install `tkinter`: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
* Check desktop environment

**Shortcuts failing?**

* Install `xbindkeys`: `sudo apt install xbindkeys`
* Check system shortcut conflicts
